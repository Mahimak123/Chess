# Chess
A simple chess game developed in Python that allows two players to play locally. This project features a basic implementation of chess rules and provides a user-friendly interface for gameplay.

**Key Features:**
Chessboard Representation: An 8x8 chessboard displayed as a 2D matrix with clear output formatting.
Piece Management: Utilizes a hash table to efficiently manage chess pieces and their initial positions.
Turn-Based System: Alternates player turns using modulus operations for effective tracking.
User Input: Players can move pieces using standard chess notation, with real-time updates to the board.
Future Enhancements: Plans for implementing move validation, check/checkmate detection, and special moves (e.g., castling, en passant).
